## EXPERT KNOWLEDGE DOCUMENTATION - FAQ FORMAT

### General PTV Questions

**Q: What is a Private Transportation Vehicle (NEV)?**
A: An PTV is a street-legal, low-speed electric vehicle designed for short-distance travel on roads with speed limits of 35 mph or less. PTVs have a maximum speed of 25 mph and must meet federal safety standards including headlights, taillights, turn signals, mirrors, seat belts, and VIN. They're perfect for neighborhood transportation, campus mobility, and short commutes.

**Q: What's the difference between an PTV and a regular golf cart?**
A: Great question! While they may look similar, there are important differences:
- PTVs are street-legal with DOT-required safety equipment (lights, signals, mirrors, seat belts, VIN)
- PTVs can drive on public roads with speed limits ≤35 mph
- PTVs require registration, insurance, and a driver's license
- Golf carts are designed for off-road use (golf courses, private property)
- Golf carts typically lack safety features required for street use
- PTVs have more robust construction and better weather protection

**Q: Do I need a driver's license to operate an PTV?**
A: Yes, a valid driver's license is required in all states where PTVs are street-legal. This is because PTVs operate on public roads alongside traditional vehicles.

**Q: Can I drive an PTV on the highway?**
A: No, PTVs are prohibited on highways, interstates, and roads with speed limits above 35 mph. They're designed for neighborhood streets, local roads, campuses, and communities.

**Q: How far can an PTV travel on a single charge?**
A: Range varies by model and conditions:
- DENAGO EV City: Up to 40 miles
- DENAGO Nomad: Up to 50 miles
- DENAGO Nomad XL: Up to 60 miles
- DENAGO Rover models: 45-55 miles
- EVOLUTION models: 50-55 miles

Range depends on factors like terrain (hills reduce range), payload weight, speed, tire pressure, temperature, and driving habits. Real-world range is typically 70-80% of maximum rated range.

**Q: How long does it take to charge an PTV?**
A: Most PTVs charge fully in 6-8 hours using a standard 110V household outlet. Fast charging with a 220V outlet reduces charge time to 3-4 hours. We recommend overnight charging for convenience. Portable chargers are included with all vehicles.

**Q: What maintenance does an PTV require?**
A: PTVs require minimal maintenance compared to gas vehicles:
- Annual service: Battery test, brake inspection, tire rotation, electrical check
- Battery care: Keep charged, avoid deep discharge, clean terminals
- Tire maintenance: Check pressure monthly, rotate annually
- Brake service: As needed (less frequent than gas vehicles due to regenerative braking)
- No oil changes, spark plugs, air filters, or transmission service needed!

Most owners spend $200-$400 annually on maintenance versus $1,000+ for gas vehicles.

**Q: How long do PTV batteries last?**
A: Lithium-ion batteries in our PTVs typically last 3-5 years or 1,500-2,000 charge cycles. Battery life depends on:
- Charging habits (avoid complete discharge)
- Storage conditions (cool, dry environment best)
- Usage patterns (moderate use is ideal)
- Temperature (extreme heat or cold reduces life)

Battery replacement costs $1,500-$3,500 depending on model. We offer battery warranty coverage and replacement programs.

**Q: Are PTVs good in winter or bad weather?**
A: Yes! PTVs work well in winter with proper preparation:
- Optional weather enclosures provide full protection
- Heated seats available on some models
- All-weather tires for better traction
- Battery performance may decrease 20-30% in extreme cold
- Store in garage when possible to maintain battery temp
- Many customers use PTVs year-round in northern climates

## PROBLEM-SOLUTION TRAINING PAIRS FOR GPT

### Technical Support Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Battery Won't Charge**
Customer: "I plugged in my PTV overnight but it's still not charged."
Response: "I understand how frustrating that is. Let's troubleshoot together:
1. Check the charger LED - is it lit? If not, test the outlet with another device.
2. Ensure the charger is fully connected to both the outlet and vehicle charging port.
3. Try a different outlet to rule out circuit issues.
4. Check your vehicle's main power switch - it should be OFF during charging.
5. If the charger LED is red instead of green, the charger may need replacement.
If none of these solve it, we should schedule a diagnostic. Our technicians can test the battery and charging system. When did you purchase your PTV, and has it charged normally before this?"

**Scenario 2: Reduced Range/Performance**
Customer: "My PTV used to go 50 miles but now only goes 30."
Response: "Reduced range can have several causes, many easily fixable:
1. **Battery age** - Batteries naturally lose capacity over 3-5 years. When did you purchase your PTV?
2. **Tire pressure** - Low pressure reduces efficiency by 15%. Check tires monthly.
3. **Temperature** - Cold weather reduces range 20-30%. Are you experiencing cold conditions?
4. **Load** - Heavier loads and passengers reduce range. Are you carrying more than usual?
5. **Terrain** - Hills significantly impact range. Has your usage changed?
6. **Battery health** - We can perform a capacity test to check battery condition.

Let's schedule a free battery diagnostic. If the battery is under warranty and tests below threshold, replacement is covered. Does that work for you?"

**Scenario 3: Commercial Fleet Inquiry**
Customer: "We need 10 PTVs for our resort property."
Response: "Wonderful! Resort applications are one of our specialties. Let me ask a few questions to recommend the perfect solution:
1. What's your primary use - guest transport, staff mobility, or maintenance?
2. How many passengers per vehicle typically?
3. What's your property terrain - flat, hilly, paved, or mixed?
4. Do you need branding or custom colors to match your resort?
5. What's your timeline for delivery?

For resorts, I typically recommend:
- EVOLUTION Carrier 6 Plus for guest transport (comfort, easy access, premium appearance)
- DENAGO Nomad for staff/maintenance (versatile, durable, all-terrain)
- DENAGO Rover for grounds crew (cargo capacity, towing, utility features)

**Fleet benefits:**
- 10-20% volume discount
- Dedicated fleet manager
- Priority service scheduling
- Fleet maintenance packages
- Custom branding included
- Delivery and staff training
- Loaner vehicles during service

I'd love to schedule a site visit to understand your needs better and provide a detailed proposal. Does next week work for your operations manager?"
