## CUSTOMER SERVICE KNOWLEDGE BASE FOR AI TRAINING

### Technical Troubleshooting Decision Trees

**Battery Issues:**
1. Won't charge
   - Check charger connection
   - Test outlet voltage
   - Inspect charger LED indicator
   - Battery management system reset
   - Professional diagnostic if persistent

2. Reduced range
   - Battery age assessment (3-5 year typical life)
   - Check tire pressure (reduces efficiency by 15% if low)
   - Analyze usage patterns (hills, speed, payload)
   - Temperature effects (cold reduces capacity 20-30%)

3. Won't hold charge
   - Cell balance test
   - Battery replacement recommendation
   - Warranty coverage check

**Motor Issues:**
1. Reduced power
   - Controller diagnostic
   - Wiring inspection
   - Motor temperature check
   - Load assessment

2. Strange noises
   - Bearing inspection
   - Mounting bolt check
   - Belt/coupling examination

**Electrical Issues:**
1. Lights not working
   - Fuse check
   - Bulb replacement
   - Wiring continuity test
   - Switch replacement
